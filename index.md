I currently have two projects hosted on GitHub which may be of interest.

## Linear Algebra Textbook

I have written/am writing a free linear algebra textbook. The book is aimed at math students who have already had some training in writing and reading proofs. I take a fields and vector spaces-first approach and try to help readers grapple with axioms. 

[Check out the textbook here](book.html)

## An R Package

In the course of writing the textbook (see above!), I wanted to be able to perform some basic calculations with matrices over finite (prime) fields. As I was learning R at the time, and as R didn't have the capabilities I wanted, I wrote a package. You can find this package [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=matrixmodp) or [on GitHub](https://rhigginbottom.github.io/matrixmodp/).
